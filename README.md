# Universal-Campgrounds

![Universal Campground](PC.png) This is an idea that would create living space for those on the move. It's a very simple idea that potentially could help travelers find a place to rest and to be safe.

A Universal Campground would provide a free space to park a vehicle, set up a tent, cook food, and offer facilities for personal hygiene such as privacy-oriented showers, sinks, and toilets. Other potential improvements would include an underground storm-shelter and communication kiosks.

There would be no fees attached to using the campground. This is the universal aspect of the campground. There would be no limitation to the amount of time a party could stay at the campground.

The campground would need a staff of several individuals willing to ensure that the area is kept safe and tidy, and the basic facilities are kept in working order.

Campgrounds would be located around cities. Thus homeless people would naturally flock to a Universal Campground as it serves their basic needs.

As part of the campground landscape, trees, shrubs, gardens, and water-conversation areas would also be positive aspects of a campground that would improve living-conditions.

The project's goal would be to continually expand to every city until everyone with the need for it was accommodated.
